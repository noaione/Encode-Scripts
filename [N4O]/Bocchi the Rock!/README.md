## Bocchi the Rock!

This folder contains the encode script for Bocchi the Rock! released here: https://shigoto.n4o.xyz/release/tags/bocchi-the-rock

- Anything with `.vpy` is the actual script.<br />
- `encode_common.py` contains some common function and stuff that I use for the whole thing.
- `masks` contains custom mask that I use to mask out something from the video
- `Endcard` contains the custom endcard assets (without the actual video that I use)

### Notes
- Endcard 05 background does not match the actual background used in episode since I failed to find close enough clean background.
- All endcard original data can be found here: https://github.com/n4o-fansub/Bocchi-sang-Roker/blob/master/common/bocchi_NextEPSign.ass
