## Bocchi the Rock!

This folder contains the encode script for Bocchi the Rock! released here: https://shigoto.n4o.xyz/release/tags/bocchi-the-rock<br />
The subtitles used for this encode can be found here: https://github.com/n4o-fansub/Bocchi-sang-Roker

- Anything with `.vpy` is the actual script.<br />
- `encode_common.py` contains some common function and stuff that I use for the whole thing.
- `masks` contains custom mask that I use to mask out something from the video
- `Endcard` contains the custom endcard assets (without the actual video that I use)

### Notes
- All transparent endcard image are generated from here: https://github.com/n4o-fansub/Bocchi-sang-Roker/blob/master/common/bocchi_NextEPSign.ass
- The following are notes for endcard background
  - 05: No close match, using personal screenshot
  - 06: Two version, one has the guitar case """cleaned"""
  - 08: Custom rain particles
  - 12: Same with 05, using the sky because of the episode title.
